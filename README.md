# Heartfaliure_prediction

# Project Goal
> - The goals of this project are the predict the factors the lead to death event of patient having heart failure symptoms, to produce a prediction model using ML algorithms and to offer recommendation to reduce such deah event

# Project Description
> - I will conduct an in depth analysis to his heart faliure data that I acquired from Kaggle. The data in Kaggle was based on a dataset of 299 patients with heart faliure collected in 2015 at Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan), during Aprilâ€“December 2015. I will used exploratory analysis followed by some statiscal testing to find some important factors leading to heartfaliure deaths and then apply classiifcation ML algorithms to make model that can predict the death event.

# Initial Questions
> - How likely is death due to heart failure?
> - How is age related?
> - Is there is any link age and time?
> - How does creatinine affect death event?
> - How does ejection fraction relate?
> - Does all combined ailemnts create higher chances of death event?
